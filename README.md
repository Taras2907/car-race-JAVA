# Battle-ships
For better understanding of OOP principle inheritance I wrote a simple game displayed in the terminal.
This game is about combining classic game and elements of simulator. There is a game board with your ship (green color) and enemy ships (red color). Game provides us with few kinds of ships such as Cruiser, Destroyer, Dreadnought, Frigate. Each ship has own special characteristics like speed or different kinds of turrets with two cannons of different calibre. The main goal of the game is to defeat the enemies. To win player should aim and shoot considering speed of wind and enemy ships. Player provided with game messages that help to understand basics of the game. 

Tech stack: JAVA 8, OOP(inheriatance, composition, aggregation)
